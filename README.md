# Breast-Tumor-Classification
This repository contains a machine learning-based project to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model leverages structured data to assist in early and accurate diagnosis, which can be crucial for timely medical interventions.

What is Breast Tumor Classification?

Breast tumor classification is the process of identifying whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on medical data such as features derived from biopsy samples. This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm, to create a reliable classification model for this task.

The dataset typically contains features like:

    Tumor radius
    Texture
    Smoothness
    Compactness
    Symmetry
    Fractal dimension

Goal: To predict the class of a tumor using these features, assisting in faster diagnosis and better decision-making.

Requirements:

    numpy (for numerical computations)
    pandas (for data manipulation)
    scikit-learn (for SVM and other ML utilities)
    matplotlib (for visualizations)
    seaborn (for data exploration)
